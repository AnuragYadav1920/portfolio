          Iâ€™m a passionate Web Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React and Node.js. I specialize in building responsive, user-focused websites and applications that not only look great but also function seamlessly across devices. With a sharp eye for detail and a mindset geared toward clean, maintainable code, I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering efficient, scalable solutions. My goal is to bridge the gap between design and functionality, ensuring every project is both visually compelling and technically robust.
